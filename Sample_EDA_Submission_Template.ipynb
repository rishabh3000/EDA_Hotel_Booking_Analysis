The dataset used in the project contains information on bookings made by guests such as booking dates, lead times, number of adults/children, room types, and cancellation status. The main objective of this EDA is to gain insights into the booking patterns and trends of guests and to identify factors that contribute to booking cancellations. The analysis includes data cleaning, data visualization, and statistical analysis using Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn. The findings of this EDA can be useful for hotel managers and marketers to optimize their pricing strategies, room allocation, and cancellation policies."
